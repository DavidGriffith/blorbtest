Here are two test programs intended to explore an ongoing problem of not 
being able to make libsndfile read an OGGV file from an IFF container.  

sampletest <filename>
This program simply loads an audio file and writes it out again as 
"sampleout.aiff".  It'll take, at least, WAV, AIFF, or OGGV

blorbtest <filename> <sound resource number>
This program loads a Blorb file, reads the indicated sound resource 
number, and writes it out as "blorbout.aiff".  If the sound resource 
happens to be a MOD, we just ignore it and exit.

Test Files:

buzzer.aiff and boothead.ogg
Short audio samples in AIFF and OGGV formats.

test.blorb
This is the IFF container.  It contains the two audio files described.  
Sound resource numbers begin at 3.  This means that resource numbers 3 
and 4 are valid.  All others are not.

test.blurb
This was used to generate the above Blorb file.  The program that 
generates the Blorb is found here: 
http://inform7.com/sources/src/cBlorb/Woven/index.html or more 
conveniently, here:

The Blorb format is an IFF format container.  For more information, see:
